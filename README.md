    # A template file contains several named templates.
    # Each template begins with [[ and ends with ]]
    msg.hello.0 = [[Hello there!]]

    # Variables are referenced using a $
    msg.hello.1 [[Hello $name!]]
    
    # Braces must be used if the variable name contains special characters (incl. period)
