    # The = after the template name is optional
    # Variables are referenced using a $
    greeting2 [[Hello $name!]]
    
    # Parenthesis must be used if the variable name contains a period
    greeting3 = [[Hello $(your.name)!]]
    
    # Conditional expansion can be done using if statements
    dog.bark = [[
    $if(Happy)
      Woof!
